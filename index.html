    <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Hello World!</strong> I'm Emma Frampton, as you can tell from the title of this webpage. I took some Codecademy classes, but I'm looking forward to learning coding in a more formal setting. I'm a full-time student at <strong>TTU,</strong> majoring in Advertising and minoring in Creative Media Industries. I've got two internships going on, where I create content for and manage social media pages.</p>

    <h2>Here's what a psychic told me I'd be doing in ten years</h2>
    </div>
    <p>I'm a millionaire with <em>no kids,</em> but I'm happily married to another millionaire. We're on the Forbes "40 Under 40" list. I'm 31 - almost 32 - and am next door neighbors with Kylie Jenner.</p>
    <p>I work from my lavish home in the Hidden Hills and run her social media. I'm starting to take her fame away from her since I have more personality, but she's okay with it. Kris Jenner, on the other hand... <em>isn't.</em></p> 
    <p>My cat, Green Beans, is living his best kitty life. He plays all around our giant mansion, and eats the <em>best food.</em></p>
    <p>I donate a large amount of money to causes I care about. SpaceX, human trafficking, and environmental protection programs are some of the causes. A new cause I'm getting into is the saving of jellyfish. Jellyfishes are so <em>beautiful</em> and need to be protected!</p>

        <figcaption>I mean why wouldn't you wanna save these cuties?</figcaption>

    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>A fun fact about me is that I don't eat seafood. I used to eat it when I was a kid, but since around my second birthday - or when my first pet betta fish died - I haven't eaten seafood.</p>
    <p>So... <em>maybe...</em> I really am a jellyfish. I know aquatic animals eat each other, but in my head, it makes sense to me that I don't eat seafood because <em>FISH ARE FRIENDS, NOT FOOD!</em></p>
